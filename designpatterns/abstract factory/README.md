# Definition


## When to use the Abstract Factory pattern

* When you have many objects that can be added or changed dynamically during runtime
* When encapsulating methods that order the objects, factories that build the objects and the final objects
* For composition: created objects use the Strategy pattern

## Benefits

* Allows to create families of objects without specifying a concrete class
* Allows to model anything you can think of and have the objects interact through a common interface
* Negative: Things can get complicated
