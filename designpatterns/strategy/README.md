#Definition
Define a family of algortihms, encapsulate each one and make them interchangeable. The Strategy pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients who use it.

##When to use the Strategy pattern

**When defining a class with behavior that is similar to other behaviors in a list**

*For example:*
*I want the class object to be able to choose from*
_* Not Flying_
_* Fly with Wings_
_* Fly Super Fast_

**When using one of several behaviors dynamically**
