#Object-oriented design patterns

**Class**
* has Fields (what it knows)
* has Methods (what it does)

**Inheritance**
* Abstract out features of classes to a superclass
* Override or extend methods that don't work
*Use when subclass needs most of the methods in a superclass*
*Avoids duplicate code, subclasses automatically have superclass methods*

**Encapsulation**
* Use object methods to change its attributes
* Ensures that the changes are legal and encapsulates the checks within the class

Inheritance or attribute?
* Is a - inheritance
* Has a - attribute
